uDMX-linux
==========

This is a small command-line utility to drive the www.anyma.ch/uDMX interface.
It allows to set DMX values manually from the commandline. Fixtures and
values can be predefined with aliases in a rc file.

The initial source code comes from http://udmx.googlecode.com/.
It compiles with minimal tweaks, but the resulting code core-dumps.

This is a cleaned-up and improved version, with alias support built in.

You need a uDMX interface to use it, of course.
