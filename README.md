uDMX-linux
==========

This is a small command-line utility to drive and test the www.anyma.ch/uDMX interface.

The initial source code comes from http://udmx.googlecode.com/.i
It compiles with minimal tweaks, but the resulting code core-dumps.

This is cleaned-up and partially rewritten uDMX program.

You need a uDMX interface to use it, of course.
